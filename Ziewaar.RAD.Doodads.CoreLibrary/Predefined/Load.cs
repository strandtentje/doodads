[Description("""
             Services communicate via interactions. Interactions always have 
              - Memory 
              - Register
              
             Memory is addressed using names, the Register is not; the Register generally
             contains the working value a service may presume it needs to do work on. 
             
             When invoking child services, a service may override things in memory or the
             register, but when control leaves the service to its parent service, those 
             overrides will not persist; hence Memory and Register is scoped as one traverses
             deeper into the program.
             
             This idea puts variables and variable naming into the back seat for focussing on the 
             order of operations instead. However, it does mean, sometimes you need to move something
             into or out of the Register, or Memory. This is what Load and Store are for.
